Designed and verified a 32-bit N-way superscalar RISC-V processor in SystemVerilog with out-of-order execution based 
on MIPS R10K, featuring register renaming, non-blocking caches, and a tournament branch predictor; developed custom 
testbenches and SVAs to validate functionality and achieved a 7.8ns clock period with 8.79ns/inst performance
